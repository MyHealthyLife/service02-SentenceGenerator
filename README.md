# Sentence Generator Service

This service provides some useful tools to retrieve motivational sentences to stimulate the user to make some specific activities or reach his/her goals. Every sentence has a type, so to organize them in the service set. For instance, the service can be used from the upper layers to provide a motivational phrase, in order to stimulate the user to reach a specific number of steps during the day. This service exposes a series of methods to read and update the sentences (and their types) through a SOAP interface.
